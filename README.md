# PrivacyPal 🛡️

**PrivacyPal** is a browser extension that helps users take control of their personal data by capturing and storing privacy policies and terms of service locally — fully offline, with no tracking.

## 🚀 Features (MVP)

- Detects when you're viewing a Privacy Policy or Terms of Service
- Extracts and saves the full visible text of the page locally
- Stores domain, timestamp, and URL
- Provides a popup UI to review saved policies

All data is stored locally using `chrome.storage.local`, and no data ever leaves your machine.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Manifest V3
- chrome.storage API
- Popup UI (HTML/CSS/JS)
